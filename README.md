# Five In A Row Game

One of the first iPhone games I made.  The purpose was primarily to learn Cocoa and Objective-C.  The game is a version of a "five-in-a-row" game.

The game is a lot more complex than it needs to be, because it includes a level editor for making custom play spaces.  The standard game works okay, although you actually only need to get three in a row to complete a line.  To play a level game you will need to go into the level editor and set up a level group, and then make some levels.  On the map editor screen, you double tap a cell in order to add a colored piece to the cell.

This game was never released on the app store, and it listed here under MIT License.  I'd question the sanity of anyone who takes this code and releases on the app store, but if you do, I'd appreciate being acknowledged as the original author.
