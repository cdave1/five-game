# Five In A Row Game

One of the first iPhone games I made to learn Cocoa and Objective-C. The game is a version of a "five-in-a-row" game.

The game is a lot more complex than it needs to be, because it includes a level editor for making custom play spaces.  The standard games works okay, although you actually only need to get three in a row to complete a line.

This game was never released, and it listed here under MIT License.  I'd question the sanity of anyone who took this code and released it on the app store, but if you do, I'd appreciate being acknowledged as the original author.
